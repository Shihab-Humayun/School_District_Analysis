# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview - Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this school district analysis is to implement the loc method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators to select the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. After that, I used the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN. With the 9th grade math and reading scores changed to NAN, I recreated the metrics which are the district summary, the school summary, the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate, the average math score for each grade level from each school, the average reading score for each grade level from each school, and the scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.

## Results

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type


## Summary
Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
